    - Trial Randomization (ITSR).ipynb: Code to pre-generate randomized trial orders, which are saved in schedules/.
- schedules/: JSON files containing pre-generated randomized trial orders. The experiment code loads session[ID].json as the trial schedule, where [ID] is the participant's ID number (assigned automatically by our pre-session questionnaire that was conducted on LimeSurvey).
- stimuli/: All wav files used as stimuli in the experiment.
    - tones/: Contains raw and loudness-normalized versions of each tone and metronome tick used in the experiment. Tones are labeled by their pitch class and octave, e.g. toneA3 is A3 (220 Hz).
    - sequence\_[register]_[pitch]\_[IOI]\_[loudness].wav: The stimulus sequence for trials of the specified register (0=lower, 1=upper), pitch within that register (0-5), IOI, and loudness (0=quiet, 1=normal, 2=loud).
- experiment.js: The jsPsych code for running the experiment on Pavlovia.
- index.html: The HTML code for running the experiment on Pavlovia. Note that the jsPsych library sources are not included in this repository, as Pavlovia hosts their own copy of jsPsych that our HTML code automatically accessed.
- limesurvey_consent.lss: The LimeSurvey template for the consent form.
- limesurvey_questionnaire.lss: The LimeSurvey template for the participant demographic questionnaire.


# Data Codebook for Experiment 5

- internal_node_id: jsPsych's internal event IDs.
- code_version: The version of the experiment that was run (always 1.0).
- event: The type of event the row contains data for (more detailed than trial_type). Can be one of the following:
    - welcome: Welcome screen.
    - requirements: Screen explaining study requirements (headphones, quiet space, etc.).
    - headphone_test_instructions: Instructions for the headphone test.
    - headphone_test_tones: Stimulus presentation for the headphone test.
    - headphone_test_response: Participant response for the headphone test.
    - main_instructions: The instructions for the main tempo rating task.
    - metronome: Presentation of the standard reference metronome.
    - practice_tones: Presentation of the repeating tone on a practice trial.
    - tones: Presentation of the repeating tone.
    - response: The participant's tempo rating response for a trial.
    - summary_instructions: The post-practice instructions re-summarizing the task.
    - break: A self-paced break between blocks of trials.
    - ending: The ending screen thanking the participant.

### Condition Data
- subject: The ID number of the participant.
- range: Which register the participant was assigned to (0=lower, 1=upper).
- stimulus: The text displayed on the screen or the audio file played during that event.

### Response Data
- rt: The number of milliseconds after the event began that a response was recorded.
- key_press: The key ID number that was pressed in response to the event. (For events that use keyboard responses.) See <http://www.foreui.com/articles/Key_Code_Table.htm> for a dictionary of key codes.
- button_pressed: The button ID number that was pressed in response to the event. (For events that use button responses.)
- response: The tempo rating response given on a trial (from 0 to 100).


## Codebook for processed data (response_data.csv)
(Each row represents one trial.)
### Metadata
