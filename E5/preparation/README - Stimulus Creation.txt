STIMULUS CREATION

The process for creating stimuli follows the steps below:

1) Use the first few cells of Tone Generation.ipynb to generate percussive
complex tones, and then save them to individual tone files (../stimuli/tones/tone__.wav).

2) Balance loudness to -20, -17, and -14 LUFS in Audacity.

3) Return to the second half of Tone Generation.ipynb. The remainder of the
code loads the normed tones and organizes them into the tone sequences used in
the experiment. The resulting sequences are saved in ../stimuli.
